# LIM-CD dataset

A Large-scale Incremental Monitoring Change Detection (LIM_CD) dataset on High Resolution Remote Sensing Images. 


## Characteristics of the LIM-CD

- Contains 9,259 images with resolutions ranging from 0.5-2 meters
- Image Characteristics: Image Source Variation, Terrain Variation, Background Variation, Resolution Variation
- Annotations Available: Change Annotations (newly added construction land regions) + Secondary Annotations (auxiliary construction land information in the pre-change image)
- Metadata Available for Each Image: Background Category, Resolution Category, Sensors Category, Terrain Category, Time Category.
- Comparison between Eight Algorithms: FC-EF, FC-Siam-conc, FC-Siam-diff, ISNet, SNUNet-CD, BIT CD, and Changeformer
